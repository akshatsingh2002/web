        <h1><strong><i> THE ANGLES: Relive the dramatic multi-car crash at the start of the British Grand Prix</i></strong></h1>
  
    <img src="Screenshot (104).png" >

    
        <p>The start of the British Grand Prix witnessed a dramatic pair of crashes, from which all the participants thankfully emerged from unharmed – although Zhou Guanyu, Alex Albon and George Russell would play no further part in the race at Silverstone as a result.

            Towards the front of the field, Zhou, a slow-starting Russell and Pierre Gasly had a coming together which sent Zhou barrelling into the barriers – while further back, a collision between Sebastian Vettel and Alex Albon saw the Thai driver spun around, collecting the Alpine of Esteban Ocon as Yuki Tsunoda also suffered damage.

            After being extricated from his car, Zhou was checked over in the medical centre at Silverstone along with Russell, with both declared fit, while following precautionary checks after being helicoptered to Coventry Hospital, Albon too was given the all-clear on Sunday night.
