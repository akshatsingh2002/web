    <h3 style="color:red;"><i>Ocon praises 'awesome job' by Alpine ahead of Silverstone as team maintain upgrade push</i></h3>
    <img src="esteban-ocon-alpine-a521-1.jpg" witdh="400" height="200">
    <p>Esteban Ocon has expressed his astonishment that Alpine have brought significant upgrades to both of their cars for the 2022 British Grand Prix, as team boss Otmar Szafnauer explained that it could only have delivered the updates at the Enstone team’s 
        home race.

        Numerous teams have brought upgrades to Silverstone, with Williams, Mercedes and Aston Martin among them – so it’s no surprise that Alpine have also turned
         up with new parts. However, Ocon said it was surprising that the team managed to bring such a wide-ranging suite of updates to the A522, for both himself 
         and team mate Fernando Alonso.</p>
