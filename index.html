    <h2>Block chain</h2>
    <h3>What is Block Chain?</h3>
    <p>A <b>blockchain</b> is a distributed database or ledger that is shared among the nodes of a computer network. As a database, a blockchain stores information electronically in digital format.
        <br><br>
        
        Blockchains are best known for their crucial role in <u>cryptocurrency </u>systems, such as Bitcoin, for maintaining a secure and decentralized record of transactions. The innovation with a
         blockchain is that it guarantees the fidelity and security of a record of data and generates trust without the need for a trusted third party.

        One key difference between a typical database and a blockchain is how the data is structured. A blockchain collects information together in groups, known as blocks, that hold sets of
         information. Blocks have certain storage capacities and, when filled, are closed and linked to the previously filled block, forming a chain of data known as the blockchain. All new
          information that follows that freshly added block is compiled into a newly formed block that will then also be added to the chain once filled.
        
        A database usually structures its data into tables, whereas a blockchain, as its name implies, structures its data into chunks (blocks) that are strung together. This data structure
        
        inherently makes an irreversible timeline of data when implemented in a decentralized nature. When a block is filled, it is set in stone and becomes a part of this timeline. Each block in
         the chain is given an exact timestamp when it is added to the chain.
